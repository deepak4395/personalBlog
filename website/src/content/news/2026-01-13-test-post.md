## Welcome to the AI-Powered Blog

After extensive development and debugging, our automated blog generation system is now **fully operational**! This blog is powered by AI agents that fetch news, analyze content, and generate original articles about embedded systems - all without manual intervention.

### What We Built

This is not just a blog - it's a complete **automated content pipeline** that runs on GitHub's infrastructure for free:

- **AI News Aggregation**: Fetches articles from 6+ RSS feeds (Hackaday, Embedded.com, CNX Software, Zephyr Project, EE Times, Interrupt/Memfault) plus Hacker News
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Uses AI to score articles by relevance to embedded systems (threshold: 0.7)
- **Original Analysis**: AI generates 800-1200 word articles with technical analysis, not summaries
- **Smart Deduplication**: Checks existing posts by URL and title similarity to prevent duplicates
- **Automatic Publishing**: Commits markdown files and rebuilds website via GitHub Actions
- **Zero-Cost Hosting**: GitHub Pages serves the static site with custom styling

## System Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **Framework**: Astro 4.16.19 (static site generation)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom blog content classes
- **Components**: React islands for interactive elements (feedback form)
- **Typography**: Custom `.blog-content` CSS with enhanced formatting
- **Dark Mode**: System preference detection
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages from `docs/` folder

### Backend & AI

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces with 4 packages
  - `@personalBlog/core`: AI client, config loader, utilities
  - `@personalBlog/agent-news`: RSS fetcher, Hacker News client, blog generator
  - `@personalBlog/agent-diy-tutorials`: Reddit/Stack Exchange clients (future feature)
  - `@personalBlog/scheduler`: CLI orchestrator for agent execution

- **AI Provider**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (paid tier)
  - Quota: 2K RPM, 4M TPM, unlimited RPD
  - 5-second delay between requests to respect rate limits
  - Fallback chain: Gemini → Groq → OpenAI

- **Configuration**: YAML-based agent config with tiered AI models
- **Secrets**: GitHub Secrets → runtime secrets.yaml (no local SOPS needed)

### Automation Workflow

The entire system runs on **GitHub Actions** with a single workflow (`generate-content.yml`):

1. **Triggers**: Push to main, manual dispatch, scheduled (daily 6 AM UTC)
2. **Setup**: Install Node.js, pnpm, dependencies, build TypeScript packages
3. **Generate Secrets**: Creates `config/secrets.yaml` from GitHub Secrets
4. **Run Agents**: Executes from workspace root to save files correctly
5. **Check Changes**: Uses `git add` + `git diff --cached` to detect new posts
6. **Build Website**: Runs `pnpm --filter website build`
7. **Prepare Deployment**: Copies `dist/` to `docs/`, creates `.nojekyll` file
8. **Commit & Push**: Commits both `.md` sources and HTML to repository
9. **Deploy**: GitHub Pages auto-deploys from `docs/` folder

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Working Directory Issues
**Problem**: Agent was saving files to `packages/scheduler/website/` instead of workspace root.

**Solution**: Changed workflow to run CLI from workspace root using `node packages/scheduler/dist/cli.js` instead of pnpm scripts.

### 2. CSS Not Loading on GitHub Pages
**Problem**: Tailwind CSS files in `_astro/` folder were ignored by Jekyll.

**Solution**: Created `.nojekyll` file in `docs/` to disable Jekyll processing.

### 3. Navigation Links Broken
**Problem**: Links missing `/` between base path and routes (e.g., `/personalBlognews` instead of `/personalBlog/news`).

**Solution**: Used `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` with explicit slashes in all navigation links.

### 4. AI JSON Parsing Failures
**Problem**: Gemini sometimes wrapped JSON in markdown code blocks or returned invalid format.

**Solution**: 
- Strip markdown code blocks before parsing: `/^```(?:json)?\s*\n?([\s\S]*?)\n?```$/`
- Added detailed error logging (2000 chars of raw response)
- Improved prompt to explicitly request JSON-only output

### 5. Duplicate Post Detection
**Problem**: Agent posted same articles multiple times with different AI-generated titles.

**Solution**: 
- Check existing posts by **source URL** (exact match)
- Also check title similarity (60% word overlap threshold)
- Filter short words (<3 chars) for better matching

### 6. Rate Limit Errors
**Problem**: Hit Gemini's 2K RPM limit when generating 4 posts quickly.

**Solution**: Increased delay between API calls from 2s to 5s.

### 7. Blog Post Styling
**Problem**: Tailwind prose classes not rendering properly.

**Solution**: Created custom `.blog-content` CSS classes with explicit styling for headings, lists, code blocks, and typography.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of combining AI, automation, and modern web technologies. What started as a complex idea became a reality through systematic problem-solving, debugging, and iteration.

**Key learnings**: ESM imports require `.js` extensions, Jekyll ignores `_astro` folders, AI needs explicit JSON instructions, and deduplication requires URL checking, not just titles.

The blog is now **live, automated, and cost-free** - a testament to what's possible with GitHub Actions and AI in 2026! 🚀
