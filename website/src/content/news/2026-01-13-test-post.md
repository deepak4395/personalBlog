## Welcome to the AI-Powered Blog

This blog post confirms that our automated content generation system is working correctly. The system is designed to:

### Features

- **Automated News Aggregation**: Fetches articles from 6+ RSS feeds daily
- **AI Content Generation**: Uses Gemini API to write engaging blog posts  
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Separate agents for news and tutorials
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Runs automatically every day
- **Static Site Generation**: Built with Astro for blazing-fast performance

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro 4+ with React islands
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (free tier)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (free hosting)
- **Workflow**: GitHub Actions (automated)

### What's Next

Once the Gemini API configuration is finalized, the system will automatically:

1. Fetch tech news daily at 6 AM UTC
2. Rank articles by relevance to embedded systems
3. Generate comprehensive blog posts using AI
4. Commit markdown and HTML files to repository
5. Deploy updates to GitHub Pages

**Status**: System operational, awaiting API quota reset or alternative configuration.
