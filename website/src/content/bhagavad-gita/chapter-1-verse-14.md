Following Duryodhana's assessment of the Pandava army and Bhishma's roaring like a lion, this verse depicts Krishna and Arjuna responding by blowing their divine conches, signaling the commencement of hostilities. It sets the stage for the larger cosmic drama to unfold.

### Deeper Understanding
This verse marks a pivotal moment. The blowing of the conch shells by Krishna and Arjuna is not merely a call to battle; it symbolizes the declaration of war by the forces of dharma (righteousness) against adharma (unrighteousness). The chariot, pulled by white horses, represents purity and righteousness. Krishna, as Madhava (Lord of Lakshmi), signifies divine prosperity and auspiciousness, while Arjuna, the Pandava, represents the embodiment of human effort aligned with divine will.

The 'divine' conches suggest that this is not an ordinary war but a cosmic battle where divine forces are actively involved. The act of blowing the conches can also be seen as a symbolic purification of the battlefield, invoking divine blessings, and preparing the warriors for the intense conflict ahead. It resonates with the theme of dharma and the necessity of upholding righteousness, even when faced with difficult choices and challenging circumstances.

This verse highlights the interplay between divine grace (Krishna) and human effort (Arjuna). Arjuna's willingness to fight for dharma, under the guidance of Krishna, underscores the importance of aligning one's actions with higher principles. The resounding sound of the conches serves as a reminder of the cosmic significance of the battle and the eternal struggle between good and evil.

### Practical Application
1.  **Align Actions with Values:** Just as Arjuna prepared for battle aligned with dharma, we can reflect on how our actions align with our core values. Are we making choices that reflect our commitment to integrity, compassion, and justice? Even in everyday situations, we can strive to act in ways that uphold our principles.

2.  **Seek Guidance:** Arjuna had Krishna as his guide. In our lives, we can seek guidance from mentors, teachers, or spiritual leaders who can help us navigate difficult situations and make choices that align with our values. This could be through formal mentorship or informal discussions with trusted individuals.

3.  **Embrace Challenges:** The battlefield represents the challenges we face in life. The blowing of the conch symbolizes a call to embrace these challenges with courage and determination. By viewing challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, we can transform obstacles into stepping stones.

### Reflection
*   How do you define your personal dharma, and how do you ensure your actions align with it?
*   What 'conches' do you blow in your own life to signal the start of important endeavors or challenges?
*   In what ways can you seek and incorporate divine guidance in your daily life?

## Key Concepts

*   **Dharma:** Righteousness, duty, cosmic order. It represents the principles that uphold the universe and guide ethical conduct.
*   **Divine Grace:** The role of divine intervention and blessings in human affairs. Krishna's presence signifies the importance of surrendering to a higher power.
*   **Human Effort:** The necessity of individual action and striving in alignment with divine will. Arjuna's readiness to fight exemplifies the importance of human agency.
*   **Symbolism:** The use of symbols like the chariot, white horses, and conch shells to convey deeper spiritual meanings and truths.
