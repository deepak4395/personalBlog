## The Shloka

**Sanskrit (Devanagari):**
दृष्ट्वा तु पाण्डवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा ।
आचार्यमुपसङ्गम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् ॥ २ ॥

**Transliteration (IAST):**
dṛṣṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkaṁ vyūḍhaṁ duryodhanastadā |
ācāryam upasaṅgamya rājā vacanam abravīt || 2 ||

## Explanation

### Context
This verse marks the beginning of Sanjaya's narration to Dhritarashtra, setting the scene for the Kurukshetra war. It introduces Duryodhana's perspective as he observes the Pandava army. This is immediately before Arjuna's crisis of conscience, which prompts Krishna's teachings.

### Word-by-Word Meaning
*   **dṛṣṭvā:** having seen
*   **tu:** but, then
*   **pāṇḍavānīkam:** the army of the Pandavas
*   **vyūḍham:** drawn up in battle array
*   **duryodhanaḥ:** Duryodhana (the king)
*   **tadā:** then
*   **ācāryam:** to the teacher (Drona)
*   **upasaṅgamya:** approaching
*   **rājā:** the king
*   **vacanam:** words
*   **abravīt:** spoke

The verse highlights Duryodhana's position as a king (rājā) and his act of approaching his teacher (ācāryam) Drona. 'Vyudham' indicates the Pandava army is well-organized and ready for battle, which immediately concerns Duryodhana.

### Deeper Understanding
This verse sets the stage for the Bhagavad Gita by illustrating Duryodhana's initial reaction to the Pandava army. It underscores the importance of perspective. Duryodhana, driven by ego and attachment to power, sees the well-organized Pandava army as a threat. His actions are motivated by fear and a desire to maintain his kingdom, reflecting his adherence to *adharma* (unrighteousness). Approaching his teacher Drona shows a reliance on worldly wisdom and strategy, yet it lacks the spiritual insight that Arjuna seeks from Krishna.

Krishna is subtly contrasted here. Duryodhana seeks Drona's advice to maintain his unrighteous claim, whereas Arjuna will seek Krishna's guidance to understand his dharma. This contrast between seeking guidance from worldly teachers versus a divine guide is central to the Gita's message.

### Practical Application
1.  **Recognizing Fear-Based Reactions:** Just as Duryodhana reacts out of fear, we often make decisions based on anxiety and insecurity. This verse invites us to examine our own motivations. Are we acting from a place of love and compassion, or are we driven by fear of loss or failure? Practicing mindfulness can help us identify these fear-based reactions and choose more constructive responses.

2.  **Seeking Wise Counsel:** Duryodhana approaches his teacher for advice. We, too, should seek guidance from mentors and wise individuals. However, it's crucial to discern the nature of that counsel. Is it aligned with our values and principles, or does it reinforce our ego and attachments? Seek guidance that promotes inner growth and ethical behavior.

3.  **Perspective and Perception:** Duryodhana's perception of the Pandava army is colored by his own desires and fears. We must remember that our perception shapes our reality. By cultivating a more balanced and objective perspective, we can avoid distorted judgments and make wiser decisions. Consider multiple viewpoints before forming conclusions.

### Reflection
*   How does fear influence your decisions and actions?
*   What criteria do you use to choose your mentors and advisors?
*   How can you cultivate a more balanced perspective in your life?

## Key Concepts

*   **Perspective (Drishti):** The verse emphasizes how one's viewpoint shapes their understanding of a situation. Duryodhana's fear and attachment color his perception of the Pandava army.
*   **Dharma vs. Adharma:** Duryodhana's actions represent *adharma*, as he is driven by ego and a desire for power, contrasting with the righteous path of the Pandavas.
*   **Guidance (Upadesha):** The act of seeking counsel is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of choosing wise mentors and discerning the quality of their advice.
*   **Ego (Ahamkara):** Duryodhana's actions are rooted in ego, leading him to perceive the Pandavas as a threat to his kingdom and power.
